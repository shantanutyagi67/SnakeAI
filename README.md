# SnakeAI

Steps:
1. enter bame board size
2. enter difficulty
3. board appears
4. hit space to start the game
5. while playing the game, if you wish to reset the game, press enter and to start playing again, hit spacebar again
6. while playing the game, if you wish to pause the game, press P key to pause the game but the game timer will not stop, hit P again.
7. you can pass through the walls
8. score and time is displayed on the top and the game mode at the bottom
9. if you die, the board reets and you need to hit spacebar again to restart the game.

note: snake is not allowed to move in a 180 degree direction but if you press the keyboard keys for any 90 degree direction and then 
for 180 degree direction, the sanake will go in reverse direction and die if its length is > 4 units. this is because you press keys
faster than the refresh rate of the screen(movement speed of the snake). This will be taken care of in the future updates.

Thankyou
