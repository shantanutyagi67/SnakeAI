# for developers
for shortest path DFS AI Algo:
when snake length is 1, it disobeys direction rules so have to fix that or can initialize snake with length 2
need to record score for each iteration in a txt, plot graph and analyze the data in MATLAB
this path is not necessarily the least distance valid path between the head and food but the shortest path DFS could find.

# next release
shortest path BFS AI Algo: it will find the actual shortest distance valid path

Thankyou
